## Build & Deploy Workflow — FOLLOW EVERY TIME

### Web (Vercel)
Auto-deploys from main branch. Push to GitHub, Vercel handles the rest.

### Android (Google Play)
1. **Corazon (Windows laptop):** Make code changes, test locally
2. `git add . && git commit -m "description" && git push`
3. **SY094 (Mac) or Corazon with Android Studio:**
   - `cd` to project directory
   - `git pull`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run build`
   - `npx cap sync android`
   - Open in Android Studio: `npx cap open android`
   - Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   - Signing key: `android/app/coexist-release.jks` (password in env vars `COEXIST_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `COEXIST_KEY_PASSWORD`)
   - Test on device/emulator
   - Upload AAB to Google Play Console

### iOS (App Store)
1. **Corazon:** Make code changes, commit, push
2. **SY094 (Mac via SSH):**
   - `cd` to project directory
   - `git pull`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run build`
   - `npx cap sync ios`
   - `npx cap open ios` (opens Xcode)
3. **Xcode (via SY094 GUI or VNC):**
   - Select target device/Generic iOS Device
   - Product > Build (verify no errors)
   - Product > Archive
   - Distribute App > App Store Connect
   - Upload
4. **App Store Connect:** Submit for review (or TestFlight first)

### Pre-Build Checklist (EVERY build)
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors
- [ ] Version bumped in `capacitor.config.ts` (versionCode + versionName)
- [ ] Version bumped in `android/app/build.gradle`
- [ ] Version bumped in `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` (if iOS)
- [ ] All environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Tested on mobile (responsive) before native build
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools

## Android Splash Screen (Fixed Apr 14 2026)

**Problem:** Default Vite/Capacitor splash screen showing instead of Co-Exist branding. Splash not fully disappearing on some devices.

**Root cause:** `splash.png` in all `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-*` folders was the 4KB default Capacitor placeholder.

**Fix applied:**
- Generated branded splash screens using `scripts/generate-splash.cjs` (uses jimp)
- Co-Exist logo (`public/logos/black-logo-transparent.png`, 1024x1024) centered on `#fafaf8` background
- All 11 density variants generated (6 portrait + 5 landscape)
- Config in `capacitor.config.ts` was already correct (`androidSplashResourceName: 'splash'`)

**Regenerating splash screens:** `node scripts/generate-splash.cjs` from project root.

**Android 12+ note:** Uses `androidx.core:core-splashscreen`. The system splash shows `@drawable/splash` via `AppTheme.NoActionBarLaunch` in `styles.xml`. Then Capacitor's plugin shows its own splash. If splash lingers, check `launchAutoHide` and `launchShowDuration` in `capacitor.config.ts`.

## Scope & Contract Notes
- **Clauses 2.5 and 10.2** define what's in/out of scope. Read the agreement BEFORE exploring technical solutions for new requests.
- Squarespace sync request (Apr 13) was out of scope per these clauses. Check contract first, always.
- One round of revisions included in quote.

---

## Known Issues
- Splash screen on Android: FIXED (Apr 14) — needs rebuild + deploy to verify on device
- Hero images fix: LIVE (commit 6018cc0)
- Blank page fix: LIVE
- Security keys: purged
- Supabase key rotation: still needed (Tate's action)

---

## Architecture Notes
- Capacitor wraps the Vite/React web app for native
- `capacitor.config.ts` is the central config for all native behaviour
- Android signing key at `android/app/coexist-release.jks`
- Push notifications via FCM (Android) + APNs (iOS) — `google-services.json` required in `android/app/`
- Edge-to-edge rendering enabled in `MainActivity.java`
- ESM project (`"type": "module"` in package.json) — use `.cjs` extension for CommonJS scripts

---

## Credentials & Access
- Test credentials: stored in kv_store `creds.coexist_test`
- App Store Connect: apple@ecodia.au
- Google Play Console: via Tate's Google account

## Lessons Learned
- Apr 13: Always check contract clauses before exploring technical solutions for new feature requests
- Apr 14: splash.png in Android res folders must be replaced manually or via `scripts/generate-splash.cjs` — Capacitor doesn't auto-generate from web assets
- Apr 14: jimp works on Windows where sharp fails (no native deps). Use `.cjs` extension in ESM projects.
- Apr 14: Android 12+ has TWO splash screens (system + Capacitor plugin). Both need correct assets.
